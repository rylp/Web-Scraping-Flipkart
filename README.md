**Web-Scrapping-Flipkart**</br>
Python and Beautiful Soup

Basic Idea: 
I have created a program in Python to extract useful data from the Flipkart website (https://www.flipkart.com/mobile-phones-store) about the best 20 iPhones to buy at any given point of time i.e. the Product and its Price. This extracted data is then put in a .csv file (products.csv this case) to showcase the data in an effective manner. This process of extracting useful data is called as Web Scraping.

Technologies Used:
1)	Python
2)  BeautifulSoup
2)	Urllib
3)	Requests
4)	MS Excel(for .csv file generation)
